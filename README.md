# MANHANG


## Overview


Manhang is an implementation of the popular game (you guessed it) [Hangman](/Users/irvingangulo/dev/manhang-2/README.md). The game consists of guessing a word that another player, the computer in this case, has selected. For this implementation, the user will have 6 chances to guess the word. 

<!-- After the user finishes, the word meaning is automatically searched in two (2) dictionaries, Oxford University Press and Webster-Merrian Online. -->


### Deployed Site

[Manhang on Heroku](https://manhang-irv.herokuapp.com/)


## Features
I have included several features in this project as a way to make the game a bit more appealing. Some of these features are: 

- Display word defintions at end of game.

- Drawing of the figure to higlight remaining trials.

- Implementation of difficulty, min and max word lengths, through the provided Reach API.

## Featured APIs and technologies
- Canvas API: Display drawing.

- Dictionaries: I am using Oxford and Merriam-Webster APIs to search for the meaning of the words once the game is finished, if the word is not found, a messag esaying "No definition found" is displayed.

- Modules: JavaScript modules using import and export statements to help with code maintenance and clarity. 

- Fetch API: Requests data from web server.

- Responsive design: Using flexbox, to adjust screen to different sizes. Needs improvement for mobile devices, although it displays well.

<!-- Alphabet interface, remaining trials
express.router -->

## Setup
### Prerequisites
