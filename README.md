# MANHANG


## Overview


Manhang is an implementation of the popular game (you guessed it) [Hangman](/Users/irvingangulo/dev/manhang-2/README.md). The game consists of guessing a word that another player, the computer in this case, has selected. For this implementation, the user will have 6 chances to guess the word. 

<!-- After the user finishes, the word meaning is automatically searched in two (2) dictionaries, Oxford University Press and Webster-Merrian Online. -->
